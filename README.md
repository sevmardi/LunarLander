# Reinforcement Learning Project - LunarLander-v2
## Problem statement
[LunarLander-v2](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2) is an environment in OpenAI's gym package. The aim is to learn an agent to guide a space vehicle from starting point to the landing pad without crashing. The state space is **R**<sup>8</sup> and there are four possible actions { do nothing, fire left orientation engine, fire main engine, fire right orientation engine }.

## Software requirements

* python 2.7
* numpy
* OpenAI's gym [package](https://github.com/openai/gym)
* Keras with tensorflow or theano

### Soft dependency - no need to install in the standard way
* Keras-rl [package](https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl) - required for running the high benchmark agent.

## Setting up the project :
